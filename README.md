# Tilemap Editor 
This is a Tilemap editor that is to be used for making maps for the Pikuma Game Engine. 
The Editor uses the ECS system from that course and you can load and save data to [.map] files.
When saving and loading, the editor uses a [.lua] file that loads the the location of the 
[.map] files and the tilesets that are used.
